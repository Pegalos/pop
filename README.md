## The official KrakenCore package manager
yes this is real uhh
use this in krakencore, you cant access this elsewhere unless you are smart

## Not getting the latest package?
use ```pop refresh``` to refresh all your installed packages
(WARNING: DO NOT USE ```reset``` UNLESS YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT LOSING ALL YOUR DATA)

Sometimes it takes around 10-20 minutes for pop to refresh from the last update, so be patient.

if ur running on electron, then idfk how long itll take to update lol

## Remember, check your version!
